# Little Learners

A modern school website designed with a light and clean neubrutalist aesthetic.  
Focused on accessibility, simplicity, and a modern visual experience.

## Status

Currently in development â€” updating section by section based on the Figma design.

## Project Overview

**Little Learners** is a concept website for an educational institution.  
It combines playful yet structured UI inspired by the Neubrutalist design trend, offering clarity, contrast, and bold visual hierarchy â€” all in a light theme.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** â€” semantic markup with a focus on accessibility (A11Y) and SEO
- **SCSS** â€” modular structure using BEM methodology, compiled into compressed CSS
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** â€” interactive behavior without frameworks
- **Vite** â€” fast dev server and production bundler
- **Git + GitHub** â€” version control and deployment
- **Public Assets Structure** â€” static fonts, images, and favicons placed in `/public`

## Features

- Clean, semantic HTML
- Clean and responsive layout
- Light & bold UI in Neubrutalism style
- Pixel-perfect implementation from Figma
- SCSS partials and structured components
- Fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement) during development
- Ready-to-use optimized build (`dist/`)
- Public assets for static serving (fonts, icons, images)

## ðŸš€ Deployment

Currently hosted on **GitHub Pages**.  
The project is also fully ready for deployment on platforms like **Netlify** or **Firebase Hosting** using the production-ready `dist/` folder generated by Vite.
